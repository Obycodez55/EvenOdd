      <h2>What are Even Numbers?</h2>
      <p>
        Numbers that are completely divisible by 2 are termed as even numbers.
        These numbers when divided by 2 leave 0 as the remainder. <br />Even
        numbers are those numbers that can be divided into two equal groups or
        pairs and are exactly divisible by 2. For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and
        so on are even numbers. These numbers can be grouped in equal pairs.
        However, this grouping cannot be done for numbers like 5, 7, 9, or 11.
        So, 5, 7, 9, or 11 are not even numbers <br />
        An even number is a number that is a multiple of 2. It can be said that
        any number that is completely divisible by 2 is an even number.

      <h2>What are Odd Numbers?</h2>
      <p>
        A number which is not divisible by “2” is called an odd number. An odd
        number always ends in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. An odd number is always 1 more
        than (or 1 less than) an even number.Odd numbers are numbers which when
        divided by 2 leave the remainder 1. In other words, we can say a number,
        which is not divisible by 2, is an odd number.
